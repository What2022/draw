Color pages are pages that are specifically designed for color printing. Usually, these pages are printed on a high-quality paper stock, such as photo paper or cardstock, and they usually have a glossy finish. Many color printers can print on plain paper as well, but the results are not as good as with color pages.
Color pages typically have much higher resolution than black and white pages, so they can produce very sharp images. They also tend to be more expensive than black and white pages, due to the higher quality of the paper and ink.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/easy-diy-canvas-painting-ideas-for-beginners/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easy Diy Canvas Painting Ideas For Beginners ~ Canvas Painting Paintings Diy Beginners Simple</span></a>
