Coloring images has shown to be beneficial for people of all ages. A study done by University of Otago in New Zealand found that coloring mandalas for just six minutes can significantly reduce stress levels.
Another study, this one from England’s Lincolnshire County Council, looked at the benefits of using coloring books with therapeutic images for people with dementia. The results showed that those who colored the images had a significant reduction in anxiety and an improvement in mood.</p><p>So, what is it about coloring images that can have such a positive effect on our mental state? One theory is that when we focus on coloring, we are better able to relax and clear our minds. This can lead to a reduction in stress hormones like cortisol.</p><h2 id=how-to-draw-a-christmas-kitten-stack-folding-surprise---art-for-kids>How To Draw A Christmas Kitten Stack (Folding Surprise) - Art For Kids<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-draw-a-christmas-kitten-stack-folding-surprise---art-for-kids>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.artforkidshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-draw-kittens-feature.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.CBgneLZSCM5KpyX7xMEq6wHaEJ&pid=15.1"' alt="How To Draw A Christmas Kitten Stack (Folding Surprise) - Art For Kids"><p><em>Source: artforkidshub.com</em></p><blockquote><p>artforkidshub.</p></blockquote><h2 id=how-can-i-draw-more-realistic>How Can I Draw More Realistic?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-can-i-draw-more-realistic>#</a></h2><p>There are a few ways to improve realism in your drawings.
