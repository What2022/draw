Generally, however, you will need to start by sketching out a rough outline of the dog&rsquo;s body and head. Then, begin drawing in the fur around the dog&rsquo;s body, starting with the shortest hair and working up. You can also use a light wash of water or paint to add highlights and shadows to the fur.
How to Draw White Dog Hair Step by Step:
If you are looking to draw a white dog hair, there are a few things that you will need. First, you will need a black pen or pencil. Secondly, you will need some white paper and then you will need to draw the hair in different directions. Finally, make sure that the hair is well-drawn and consistent.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/colorful-aesthetic-art/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Colorful Aesthetic Art : Fondos Cielo</span></a>
