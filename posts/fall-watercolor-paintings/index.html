One way is to use a pencil and make small lines down the center of the mouth. Another way is to use a crayon and make deep lines around the edges of the mouth.
Drawing a realistic mouth is not as difficult as one might think. There are a few key things that you need to do in order to achieve the look you desire. First, make sure that your mouth is correctly proportioned. This means that the lips and teeth should be thin and evenly placed, and the jaw should be even and depth wise.Next, make sure that your mouth is realistically moving. This means that the lips should move in a natural way, and the teeth should move in an even motion. Finally, make sure that your mouth is open wide enough so that people can see inside.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/draw-human-face/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Draw Human Face : How To Draw Batman Full Body.
