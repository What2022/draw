The study, conducted by the University of Central Lancashire, found that coloring pages can help reduce a child’s anxiety levels and promote relaxation. The study’s lead author, Dr. Kate Williams, said that coloring pages can offer a “safe space” for children to express their emotions. “For some children, coloring can provide a much-needed outlet for anxiety and stress,” she said. “It can be a way to switch off from the outside world and focus on something calm and soothing.”\nWilliams added that coloring pages can also help to improve a child’s fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination.

A new study has found that coloring pages can have therapeutic benefits for children, especially those who suffer from anxiety or stress. The study, conducted by the University of Central Lancashire, found that coloring pages can help reduce a child&rsquo;s anxiety levels and promote relaxation.
The study&rsquo;s lead author, Dr. Kate Williams, said that coloring pages can offer a &ldquo;safe space&rdquo; for children to express their emotions. &ldquo;For some children, coloring can provide a much-needed outlet for anxiety and stress,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It can be a way to switch off from the outside world and focus on something calm and soothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Williams added that coloring pages can also help to improve a child&rsquo;s fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. So not only can they help with mental well-being, but they can also have physical benefits too.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/best-graphite-drawing-pencils/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Best Graphite Drawing Pencils ~ Top 10 Best Pencil Artists In The World</span></a>
