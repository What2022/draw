Whether you&rsquo;re looking to take a break from the grind or just need a little R&R, coloring pages can be a great way to wind down. Plus, they&rsquo;re perfect for providing relaxation and stress relief. Here are some tips on how to make your own coloring pages and what to put on them.</p><ol><li><p>Pick a theme or subject that interests you. Whether it&rsquo;s calming landscapes or happy animals, choosing something specific will help keep your mind focused while you color.</p></li><li><p>Choose calming colors that will help offset any stressors in your life. Bright blues and greens are usually relaxing, while warm tones like browns and oranges can soothe the soul.</p></li><li><p>Use calming sounds to set the mood while you color.

However, generally speaking, you should spend at least 8 hours per day practicing art.
Are you spending too much time practicing your art? If so, it may be time to cut back on the hours you&rsquo;re spending on your artwork. According to a study by the National Gallery of Art, an average person should spend no more than five hours a day practicing their art. That&rsquo;s only enough time to improve your skills and learn new techniques. If you&rsquo;re spending more than that, it may be time to consider quitting your art career altogether.</p><h2 id=90-easy-abstract-painting-ideas-that-look-totally-awesome>90 Easy Abstract Painting Ideas That Look Totally Awesome<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#90-easy-abstract-painting-ideas-that-look-totally-awesome>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.cartoondistrict.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Easy-Abstract-Painting-Ideas00015-1.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.7n49ygCZCDJ7eYvFfbiJMQHaLT&pid=15.1"' alt="90 Easy Abstract Painting Ideas that look Totally Awesome"><p><em>Source: cartoondistrict.com</em></p><blockquote><p>abstract easy painting totally awesome.</p></blockquote><p>Easy Drawing is a great way to get started with art.
