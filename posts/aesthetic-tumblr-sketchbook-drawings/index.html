Flower coloring is a process that has been used for centuries to add beauty to flowers. The history of flower coloring dates back to the early days of civilization, when people first began using natural dyes to color their flowers.

In the Middle Ages, flower coloring became more popular in Europe, and many different techniques were developed to create different colors.</p><p>Today, flower coloring is still a popular way to add beauty to flowers.
