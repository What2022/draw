Place the pen in the center of the blade and blend until the pen is completely blurred.
When it comes to drawing, some people prefer to use a pencil while others might prefer a pen. Whichever type of pencil you choose, there are a few ways to blur the lines. Depending on the purpose of your sketch, you may want to blur the edges of your drawing in different ways.<br>One way to blur the edges is by using quick strokes. To do this, hold the pencil at an angle and draw short lines across the page. This will create a blurry effect. Another way to blur the edges is by using larger strokes. This will make it difficult for viewers to see specific details on your drawing and make it more abstract.</p><h2 id=fashion-aesthetic-moodboard-purple--concept-photography-aesthetic>Fashion Aesthetic Moodboard.
