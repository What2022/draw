A good laugh is one of the best stress-relievers out there. It lowers blood pressure, releases endorphins (which are natural painkillers), and just makes us feel good all around. Laughter really is the best medicine!
But humor isn’t just good for our physical health – it can also improve our mental well-being. Studies have shown that people who laugh more are less likely to experience depression and anxiety. Laughter can also help us cope with difficult situations, by giving us a different perspective on things.</p><p>So next time you’re feeling down, try watching a funny movie or TV show, hanging out with friends who make you laugh, or even just reading a humorous book. It might just be the boost you need to get through whatever is troubling you.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/sailor-moon-drawing-ideas/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Sailor Moon Drawing Ideas : How To Draw Zarina, Tinker Bell</span></a>
