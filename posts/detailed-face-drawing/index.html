To create light and shadow in your drawing, you will need to use a light source. This can be either natural or artificial light. Once you have your light source, you can start to create shadows.</p><p>Shadows are created when an object blocks the light from reaching another object. The darker the shadow, the greater the contrast between the two objects. To make your shadows more realistic, you can use a variety of techniques such as cross hatching or stippling.</p><p>By using light and shadow in your drawings, you can create depth and interest that will make your drawings stand out from the rest.</p><h2 id=pen-and-ink-drawing-of-miguel-rivera>Pen And Ink Drawing Of Miguel Rivera<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pen-and-ink-drawing-of-miguel-rivera>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://mlyon.com/wp-content/gallery/miguel_rivera/2012_01_25_miguel_77_5x44_detail_1600.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.gcgCGh2EDZU8zLYDJ5A5lAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="pen and ink drawing of Miguel Rivera"><p><em>Source: mlyon.com</em></p><blockquote><p>pen ink drawing miguel rivera 5x44 1600 mlyon.</p></blockquote><p>Drawings are a form of art that have been around since the beginning of time. They are a way to communicate without using words and can be used to express emotions, thoughts, or ideas. Drawings can be done with many different mediums, such as pen and ink, pencil, charcoal, pastels, and more. Anyone can draw, regardless of their skill level. All it takes is a little practice and some patience.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/cute-drawings-on-canvas/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cute Drawings On Canvas : 90 Easy Canvas Painting Ideas For Beginners</span></a>
