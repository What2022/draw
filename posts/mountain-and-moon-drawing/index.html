If you want to color art like a pro, there are some basic principles you need to keep in mind. Follow these tips and you&rsquo;ll be on your way to creating beautiful works of art that look great on any wall.</p><ol><li><p>Use light and dark colors judiciously. Bright colors will make an image look cartoonish and ill-defined, while darker colors can create a more dramatic appearance. Try to use two shades of each color, as well as neutrals, to get the most out of your coloring techniques.</p></li><li><p>Use complementary colors together. When pairing different colors together, aim for those that have opposite characteristics (like red and green or yellow and blue). This will create a more balanced image that looks more realistic.</p></li><li><p>Use a variety of brushes and tools.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/easy-to-draw-poppy-flower/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easy To Draw Poppy Flower ~ Drawing Lessons : How To Draw Poppies</span></a>
