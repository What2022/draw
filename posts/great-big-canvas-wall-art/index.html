As children, we are constantly told to color inside the lines. But what if coloring outside the lines is actually a good thing? A new study has found that child coloring can lead to increased creativity and self-confidence.
So what are the benefits of child coloring? For one, it can help children develop fine motor skills. It also allows them to express their creative side, and it can be a soothing and relaxing activity. Coloring can also help improve problem-solving skills and hand-eye coordination.</p><p>So next time your child wants to color outside the lines, don&rsquo;t stop them! Encourage their creativity and let them have fun. Who knows, they may just surprise you with their masterpiece.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/cute-little-space-drawings/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cute Little Space Drawings - Cute Doodle On Tumblr</span></a>
