Making your own coloring pages is a great way to personalize your child&rsquo;s activity time. And it&rsquo;s really easy to do! All you need is a printer and some basic coloring supplies.
Here&rsquo;s how to get started:</p><ol><li><p>Find a coloring page design that you like. There are tons of free printable coloring pages available online. Do a quick search for &ldquo;free printable coloring pages&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll be sure to find something that suits your child&rsquo;s interests.</p></li><li><p>Print out the coloring page on regular printer paper. If you want your child to be able to color the page over and over again, consider printing it on cardstock or another heavier paper so it will stand up to repeated use.</p></li><li><p>Gather your child&rsquo;s favorite crayons, markers, or colored pencils and let them go to town!</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/flower-hand-drawn-doodles/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Flower Hand Drawn Doodles : Rustic Decorative Plants And Flowers Collection Stock Illustration</span></a>
