From the time we are babies, we are taught to associate different colors with different emotions. Some people believe that the color red symbolizes passion, energy, and excitement. Others believe that the color green represents happiness and nature. So what does the color purple represent? According to some people, purple is the color of love. Purple is also associated with royalty and wealth.

As artists, we often associate our creativity with the medium of drawing. But is it really true that artists are born to draw?
There&rsquo;s no definitive answer to this question, as each artist is unique and must learn how to drawer in order to express their creative potential. However, there are some general truths about creativity that are widely accepted. First and foremost, drawing is a process of connecting with one&rsquo;s intuition and source of inspiration. Secondly, it can be said that good artists have a deep understanding of their own mind and how it works. Finally, good artists often have strong emotional responses to their work - something which comes naturally to them as they&rsquo;re constantly exploring new territories for their artistry.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/fathers-day-toddler-crafts-pinterest/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fathers Day Toddler Crafts Pinterest : Father&amp;#039;s Day, Father And Fathers Day Crafts On Pinterest</span></a>
