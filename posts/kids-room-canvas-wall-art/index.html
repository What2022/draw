A new study has found that children who spend more time coloring pages are at a greater risk for developing ADHD.
The research, which was conducted by the University of Montreal, looked at 3 groups of children between the ages of 6 and 11. The first group was given a coloring book and told to color for 20 minutes. The second group was given a blank piece of paper and told to doodle for 20 minutes. The third group was given no instructions.</p><p>Afterward, all of the children were asked to complete a series of tests that measured their attention span, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. The results showed that the children who had colored were more likely to score higher on the tests than the other two groups.</p><p>This study is sure to cause concern for parents who are already worried about the amount of time their kids spend on screens.</p><h2 id=sexy-men-and-women-canvas-painting-abstract-make-love-poster-bedroom>Sexy Men And Women Canvas Painting Abstract Make Love Poster Bedroom<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sexy-men-and-women-canvas-painting-abstract-make-love-poster-bedroom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://i0.wp.com/wallartaccents.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Sexy-Men-and-Women-Canvas-Painting-Abstract-Make-Love-Poster-Bedroom-Bedside-Wall-Art-Decorative-Canvas.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KKlNJ0fNPGf57PBqkfttgAHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Sexy Men and Women Canvas Painting Abstract Make Love Poster Bedroom"><p><em>Source: wallartaccents.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Coloring isn&rsquo;t just for kids anymore.
