How do they work?
Color pages are a great way for businesses to increase engagement and get their message out to more people. They work like any other page on the website and can be shared or embedded using HTML or via a third-party service. When someone clicks on a color page, their browser will load the corresponding color version of the website&rsquo;s content. This makes it easy for users to see different versions of pages with related information all in one place.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/bearded-iris-drawings/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Bearded Iris Drawings : Iris Pencil Drawings Easy Flowers Sketches Drawing Colored Flower Line Sketch Draw Ink Irises Step Creativity Cathartic Visit Garden Bearded</span></a>
