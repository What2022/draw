If you are using crayons, break them into small pieces so that they will not smear when you color. If you are using pencils, sharpen them by rubbing the eraser end on a hard surface.
Choose a piece of paper to work on. Place it on a flat surface so that the artwork will be level when you start coloring it. Draw a grid on the large piece of paper with lines at least 2 inches wide. Put the smaller pieces of paper in the grid so that they are evenly spaced.
Start by filling in some basic colors with your crayons or pencils.</p><h2 id=pin-by-eevee-bennett-on-fursuit--fursuit-furry-anime-furry-anthro-furry>Pin By Eevee Bennett On Fursuit | Fursuit Furry, Anime Furry, Anthro Furry<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pin-by-eevee-bennett-on-fursuit--fursuit-furry-anime-furry-anthro-furry>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/dc/62/20/dc6220601f036a93c66b3944157929d7.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.mUA84foS_sghk63w9yr-_gHaLG&pid=15.1"' alt="Pin by Eevee Bennett on Fursuit | Fursuit furry, Anime furry, Anthro furry"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>fursuit fursuits furries fursuitpursuits pursuits eevee kemono.</p></blockquote><p>The Best Coloring Books for Beginners.
