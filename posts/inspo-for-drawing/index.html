Next, add in the details of the body, such as arms and legs. Finally, add in any features that will be seen in the final product.
How do you sketched a body? How do you know where to start? Here are a few tips to help you get started:</p><ol><li>Start with the head and neck. Sketch these areas first, then move on to the rest of the body.</li><li>Use a light pencil or paper for your first sketches. As you improve, you can use heavier pencils and more advanced techniques.</li><li>Remember that every sketch is different, so take time to experiment and find what works best for you.</li><li>Be patient and keep practicing until your sketches look natural and realistic.</li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/drawings-pinterest-character-art/><span class=title>Â« Prev</span><br><span>Drawings Pinterest Character Art - Gargoyle By Roman Chaliy</span></a>
