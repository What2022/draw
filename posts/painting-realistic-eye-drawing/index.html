You want something that you can easily color without getting frustrated. Second, use coloring pencils or markers instead of crayons. They will glide over the paper smoother and provide better coverage. Third, take your time and relax while you color. Don’t worry about staying in the lines or making it perfect. Just enjoy the process and let your creative juices flow!</p><h2 id=pin-by-trowcliff-on-through-the-eye-of-an-artist--eye-art-eye>Pin By TRowcliff On Through The EYE Of An Artist&mldr; | Eye Art, Eye<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pin-by-trowcliff-on-through-the-eye-of-an-artist--eye-art-eye>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b4/16/86/b416863daf652ea42b03231aad693147.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.dquAh3OZLlXxjagSwM7NXQHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Pin by TRowcliff on Through the EYE of an Artist... | Eye art, Eye"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>buntstifte realistisch wasserfarben gezeichnete buntstiftzeichnungen bestdecorationtips siterubix youcandraw.</p></blockquote><p>Looking for a fun way to relieve stress?
