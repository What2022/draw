Drawing is a form of visual expression and is one of the oldest forms of human communication. The history of drawing is as old as the history of humankind. The first drawings were probably made with natural materials such as charcoal and chalk.
Over time, different drawing techniques and media have been developed. Today, drawing is used in a variety of fields, including art, architecture, engineering, and design.</p><p>The history of drawing is a long and rich one. It is a story of how humans have used visual expression to communicate their ideas and feelings.
