A Brief History of Art Coloring
For centuries, artists have used color to create stunning works of art. But what exactly is color? And how did artists begin using it to create their masterpieces?</p><p>Color is made up of different wavelengths of light. When these wavelengths are combined, they create the colors we see everyday. For example, when red and green light are combined, we see the color yellow.</p><p>Artists began using color in their artwork long ago. One of the earliest examples is a cave painting from over 30,000 years ago that was found in France. This painting contains red ochre, a type of clay that contains iron oxide. This gives the clay a red hue, which was used to paint animals and other objects on the cave walls.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/canvas-wall-collage/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Canvas Wall Collage : Abstract Diy Modern Frames Walls Painting Digital Projects Boring Frame Transform Genius Completely Super Artwork Making Easy Centsational Bright Creative</span></a>
