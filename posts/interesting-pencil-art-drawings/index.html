A drawing can be a work of art on its own, or it can be used as a preliminary sketch for another piece of art, such as a painting or sculpture. Drawing is also used in architecture, mapmaking, and scientific illustration. The medium of drawing refers to the type of support that the artist uses. The most common types of drawing medium are pencil, pen and ink, charcoal, pastel, and marker.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/felt-pen-drawings/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Felt Pen Drawings : Letter 6, Page 5</span></a>
