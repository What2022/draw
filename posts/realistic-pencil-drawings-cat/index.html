This will help you plan how much detail to include in your drawing.</p></li><li><p>Use a brush to add small details such as hair, skin, and nipples.</p></li><li><p>Use a pen to draw in more detailed features such as fur and tattoos.</p></li><li><p>Use a wash to remove any Highlights or Shadows from the person or object.</p></li></ol><h2 id=stunning-photo-realistic-pencil-drawings-by-paul-lung--design-swan>Stunning Photo-realistic Pencil Drawings By Paul Lung | Design Swan<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#stunning-photo-realistic-pencil-drawings-by-paul-lung--design-swan>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://img.designswan.com/2012/07/cat/2.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.v6aF4Ku5ooH9ThvDGW_UcgHaKw&pid=15.1"' alt="Stunning Photo-realistic Pencil Drawings by Paul Lung | Design Swan"><p><em>Source: designswan.com</em></p><blockquote><p>pencil drawings realistic paul lung cat stunning.</p></blockquote><h2 id=how-do-you-color-with-white-pencils>How Do You Color With White Pencils?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-you-color-with-white-pencils>#</a></h2><p>To color with white pencils, use a light touch and hold the pencil over the paper so that the lead is pointing down. Use a darker color near the end of the lead to create shading.
How to color with white pencils can be a little tricky, but with a little practice it can be done. Here are some tips to help:</p><ol><li>Start by flattening the lead using your fingers or a paper towel. This will make it easier to control the color.</li><li>Next, use a lightcoloring pencil to outline any shapes or patterns in your drawing. This will give you more control over the colors that are used.</li><li>When you are ready to start coloring, use darker colors for theBackground and Foreground, and lighter colors for the Shapes and Patterned parts of your drawing. Be sure to use a contrasting color for highlights and shadows!</li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/painted-front-door-with-side-lights/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Painted Front Door With Side Lights ~ Door Doors Entry Exterior Glass Wood Sidelights Designs Puerta Paint Colors Puertas Madera Steel Aluminio Entrance Inserts Side Interior Painted</span></a>
