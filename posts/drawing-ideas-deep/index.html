Then draw two lines parallel to each other on either side of the line. Between the two lines, make a small smile. Finally, draw a line above and below the smile.
Drawing a kissy missy is something that takes practice and lots of planning. You&rsquo;ll need to consider the person you&rsquo;re kissing, their facial features, and how you want the kiss to look.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/cute-drawing-animal-pictures/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cute Drawing Animal Pictures : Subreddit For The Game Among Us By Innersloth.</span></a>
