Use light or dark colors to represent different parts of your body, objects in your environment, or other elements in your sketch. Be sure to vary the strokes width and speed so that each Sketch is different looking. When you&rsquo;re finished creating your sketches, return them to their default color for later editing and coloring.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/apollo-spacecraft-drawing/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Apollo Spacecraft Drawing : Jim Scotti&amp;#039;s Art Page</span></a>
