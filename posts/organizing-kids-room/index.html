Whether you&rsquo;re creating a coloring page for yourself or giving one as a gift, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right supplies and follow some basic tips for creating your masterpiece. Here are some guidelines to get you started:</p><ol><li><p>Choose a color palette that inspires you. When selecting colors, think about what mood or feeling you want your coloring page to evoke. For example, if you&rsquo;re creating a happy scene with flowers and sunshine, use colors like yellow, orange, and pink. If you&rsquo;re feeling dark and foreboding, use colors like black, brown, and navy blue.</p></li><li><p>Use shading and highlights to add depth and detail to your coloring pages. Shading is when light is applied at an angle to the paper; highlights are spots of light that stand out from the rest of the paper.</p></li></ol><h2 id=how-to-host-a-murder-mystery-dinner-party>How To Host A Murder Mystery Dinner Party<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-host-a-murder-mystery-dinner-party>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://fthmb.tqn.com/SpUOYP6H8Cyu2lPvJBh7W-DQLS8=/3575x2785/filters:fill(auto,1)/dining-table-set-for-dinner-party-523270356-57ffca4b5f9b5805c29b7851.jpg" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SKIbVgeUYUizWvAzSpWyGwHaFx&pid=15.1"' alt="How to Host a Murder Mystery Dinner Party"><p><em>Source: entertaining.about.com</em></p><blockquote><p>murder thespruce lyttle.</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for some cool ideas to draw, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place.
