First, use a light pencil to erase any excess color before starting to draw. Second, use a light touch when drawing, and don&rsquo;t make too much of a difference in the end result. Finally, if you have any trouble keeping your lines straight, try using a Ruler or a straight edge to help keep them in place.
There are a few ways to not color over lines in your sketchbook, but it&rsquo;s important to use caution. If you accidentally color over a line in your sketches, it can ruin the entire composition and look sloppy. Here are some tips:</p><ol><li><p>Use a follow-through tool to erase any accidental crossings of the lines. This will help make sure that all your lines are straight and even.</p></li><li><p>Use a light pencil to draw around the edges of any gaps or areas where you accidentally crossed the line. This will help fill in the spaces between the lines and give your sketches a more cohesive look.</p></li><li><p>When drawing something new, be very careful not to add too much color at once. Try to give each drawing its own space and focus on just drawing what you want to see.</p></li></ol><h2 id=35-awesome-bedding-ideas-for-masculine-bedrooms---digsdigs>35 Awesome Bedding Ideas For Masculine Bedrooms - DigsDigs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#35-awesome-bedding-ideas-for-masculine-bedrooms---digsdigs>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.digsdigs.com/photos/11-masculine-grey-and-black-bedding.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.yA0wmtE8GD5jkE6VY0upGQHaKi&pid=15.1"' alt="35 Awesome Bedding Ideas For Masculine Bedrooms - DigsDigs"><p><em>Source: digsdigs.com</em></p><blockquote><p>bedding masculine grey bedroom bedrooms digsdigs awesome.</p></blockquote><p>What is adult coloring?
