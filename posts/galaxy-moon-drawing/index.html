One reason is that you may be using too much light or shadow in your piece. You could also be using incorrect proportions in your work.
Some artists apply a great deal of pressure when creating their art, expecting it to be beautiful and soaring like the sky. Others may not put as much effort into it, thinking that their work will look flat without fail. Neither of these beliefs are correct.</p><h2 id=moon-falls--fall-drawings-water-fall-painting-abstract-art-painting-diy>Moon Falls | Fall Drawings, Water Fall Painting, Abstract Art Painting Diy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#moon-falls--fall-drawings-water-fall-painting-abstract-art-painting-diy>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/fc/b6/47/fcb64718640715da9016e6a4b7e3bdd3--painting-parties-shirt-ideas.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.JQhTWl9ejP1sjMedhsFS-AHaJV&pid=15.1"' alt="Moon Falls | Fall drawings, Water fall painting, Abstract art painting diy"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>falls.</p></blockquote><h2 id=can-i-work-as-an-artist-in-japan>Can I Work As An Artist In Japan?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#can-i-work-as-an-artist-in-japan>#</a></h2><p>Yes, you can work as an artist in Japan.
