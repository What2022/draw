Generally speaking, however, most artists believe that anyone who has reached the age of 28 can start drawing.
The age of a person to start drawing has been debated for many years. A recent study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics found that people age 28 and older are no longer able to learn how to draw well. A study done in the early 1800s showed that Native Americans were able to draw very well before they turned 28. However, this is no longer the case today.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/amazing-color-pencil-drawings-wolves/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Amazing Color Pencil Drawings Wolves ~ 21+ Wolf Drawings, Pencil Drawings, Sketches</span></a>
