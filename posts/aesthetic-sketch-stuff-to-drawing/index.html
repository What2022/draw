Next, begin to add in the hair itself. Start by Drawing the hair in a straight line from the center of your head to the edge of your mouth. Then, add in any curls or waves that you may have. Finally, use a light and dark color to create different textures and highlights.
Drawing hair can be a fun and easy way to add detail and realism to your character or scene. There are a variety of ways to draw hair, and the key is to find the right one for your needs. Here are four methods for drawing hair:</p><ol><li>Curls: Curl your hair into a bun or waves it out from behind. This will create a natural look that is easiest to style.</li><li>Choosing the Right Style: There are many different styles you can use for hair, so find one that works best for you. Stick with basic curves and shapes, and avoid curly or wavy textures.</li><li>Drawing The Hair Under Headgear: If you’re using a wig, make sure to draw the hair below the wig in order to give an accurate portrayal of its length and texture. 4.</li></ol><h2 id=pin-on-art>Pin On Art<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pin-on-art>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/48/c9/ff/48c9ffe706d631446711bbfa74991de9.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.hyFQnjPHu9Qyb1Ti4UuBtQHaKh&pid=15.1"' alt="Pin on Art"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><h2 id=how-do-you-draw-a-huggy-wuggy>How Do You Draw A Huggy Wuggy?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-you-draw-a-huggy-wuggy>#</a></h2><p>There is no one definitive way to draw a huggy wuggy.
