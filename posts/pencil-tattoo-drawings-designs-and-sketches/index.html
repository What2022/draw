Coloring images has shown to be beneficial for people of all ages. A study done by University of Otago in New Zealand found that coloring mandalas for just six minutes can significantly reduce stress levels.
Another study, this one from England’s Lincolnshire County Council, looked at the benefits of using coloring books with therapeutic images for people with dementia. The results showed that those who colored the images had a significant reduction in anxiety and an improvement in mood.</p><p>So, what is it about coloring images that can have such a positive effect on our mental state? One theory is that when we focus on coloring, we are better able to relax and clear our minds. This can lead to a reduction in stress hormones like cortisol.</p><h2 id=deadpool--marvel-art-drawings-deadpool-drawing-drawing-superheroes>Deadpool | Marvel Art Drawings, Deadpool Drawing, Drawing Superheroes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#deadpool--marvel-art-drawings-deadpool-drawing-drawing-superheroes>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/41/6d/4b/416d4b9eeb17259b3534171a47b606ae--deadpool-cartoon.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.4VrII-HdkM2KSI0P6HLZhQHaJv&pid=15.1"' alt="Deadpool | Marvel art drawings, Deadpool drawing, Drawing superheroes"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>deadpool drawings superhero marvel drawing superheroes tattoo cartoon imgur cool sketches draw cakeday apparently ago zeichnungen skizze pencil dessin animals.</p></blockquote><p>What are the benefits of art coloring?
