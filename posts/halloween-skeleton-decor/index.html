However, generally speaking, you should spend at least 8 hours per day practicing art.
Are you spending too much time practicing your art? If so, it may be time to cut back on the hours you&rsquo;re spending on your artwork. According to a study by the National Gallery of Art, an average person should spend no more than five hours a day practicing their art. That&rsquo;s only enough time to improve your skills and learn new techniques. If you&rsquo;re spending more than that, it may be time to consider quitting your art career altogether.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/galaxy-moon-drawing/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Galaxy Moon Drawing - How Long Does It Take The Sun To Orbit The Galaxy?</span></a>
