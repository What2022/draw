LINE ART POPS: How to Make Them Easily
LINE ART POPS are a great way to add personality and excitement to your art. There are many different ways to make them, but the following steps will help you make them easily. First, take a piece of paper and draw a lineart picture using basic colors. Next, cut out the lineart picture using a craft knife or scissors. Once it is cut out, use the same colors to create lines running down the Picture&rsquo;s length. Finally, take an advertising or stock photo and darken it slightly so that it looks like it has been taken on location in an actual store.
