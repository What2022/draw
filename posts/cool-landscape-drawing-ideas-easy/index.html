Finally, make sure that you have the permission of the artist or their representative before continuing.
copied art is not ok</p><p>When it comes to artwork, there are a few things that should always be kept in mind. First and foremost, copying someone else&rsquo;s work is not okay. It can damage the original piece of art, and it can also take away from the creativity of the artist. Secondly, don&rsquo;t forget that no one deserves to be left out when it comes to taking credit for their own work. Everyone has their own unique talents and abilities, so respect their work and give credit where credit is due. Finally, remember that individual expression is important, and you shouldn&rsquo;t try to change someone&rsquo;s ideas or style just because you think they might be better off without it.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/colorful-lion-drawing/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Colorful Lion Drawing : Sharp Artistic Eye Art</span></a>
