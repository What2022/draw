When it comes to drawing, there are a few basics that you need to know. First, you need to have a good pencil and paper. Second, you need to know how to hold the pencil and how to make the different strokes. And third, you need to have some patience!
If you have all of these things, then you&rsquo;re ready to start drawing. Begin by sketching out a simple shape, such as a circle or a square. Once you have the basic shape down, start adding details like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Keep working on your drawing until you&rsquo;re happy with the way it looks.</p><p>With a little practice, anyone can learn how to draw. So don&rsquo;t be discouraged if your first efforts aren&rsquo;t perfect. Just keep at it and soon you&rsquo;ll be creating amazing art!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/boy-string-art/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Boy String Art - Melayu Kamdar</span></a>
