Once they are dry, you can put them in a vase or pot and enjoy their beauty!</p><h2 id=22-best-4th-july-images--betty-boop-betty-boop-quotes-betty-boop>22 Best 4th July Images | Betty Boop, Betty Boop Quotes, Betty Boop<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#22-best-4th-july-images--betty-boop-betty-boop-quotes-betty-boop>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/474x/78/37/10/7837103ac7e445a98515bc4b699707b5--july-th-fireworks-fireworks-photos.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.zgRnHKPN4eUcEpYPVvggjQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="22 Best 4th July images | Betty boop, Betty boop quotes, Betty boop"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><h2 id=how-do-you-draw-spiderman-no-way-home-black-and-gold-suit-easy>How Do You Draw Spiderman No Way Home Black And Gold Suit Easy?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-you-draw-spiderman-no-way-home-black-and-gold-suit-easy>#</a></h2><p>There are a few ways to draw Spiderman without having to go too crazy.
