According to a study done by the Department of Psychology at the University of Sheffield, coloring can help children relax. The study found that children who were given coloring books and crayons felt more relaxed than those who were given other types of toys.
This is likely because coloring allows children to focus on one thing and tune out everything else. It’s a form of mindfulness that can help kids stay in the present moment and avoid worry about the future or ruminating on the past.</li></ol><p>So next time your child is feeling anxious or stressed, break out the crayons and let them color to their heart’s content. It just might be the relaxation they need.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/wall-decal-stickers/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Wall Decal Stickers ~ 48 Stick Figures Full Collection Package My Family Car Window Decal St</span></a>
