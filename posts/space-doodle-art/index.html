One way is to practice regularly, another is by using a tutor or book, and the third is by practicing in a controlled environment.</p><h2 id=omocat--a-set-of-four-prints-for-my-original-game>OMOCAT · A Set Of Four Prints For My Original Game:&mldr;<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#omocat--a-set-of-four-prints-for-my-original-game>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2ee57c0b879f1b1b694593e5dce9b4d/tumblr_mwzwy5tyrH1qegob8o1_500.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.9ldUVjtA17WpDKhuizI3DgHaKy&pid=15.1"' alt="OMOCAT · a set of four prints for my original game:..."><p><em>Source: omocat-blog.com</em></p><blockquote><p>omori omocat game cat story omo anime fun animation kickstarter rpg horror games amazing cool tv psychedelic pastel arte salvo.</p></blockquote><h2 id=is-drawing-a-talent>Is Drawing A Talent?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#is-drawing-a-talent>#</a></h2><p>There is no one definitive answer to this question as everyone has different strengths and weaknesses when it comes to drawing.
