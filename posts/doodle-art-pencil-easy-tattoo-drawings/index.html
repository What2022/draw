One reason is that your monitor&rsquo;s resolution is lower than the resolution of your artwork. Additionally, your monitor may not be able to show all the details in your artwork.
Digital art is often created on a computer screen. This type of art can be created in many ways, but one way is to use a program called graphics software. By using this type of software, you can make your digital art look blurry. This can make it difficult to see what is happening in the image and make it difficult to create an effective work of art.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/diy-canvas-projects/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>DIY Canvas Projects - Scarecrow Fall Canvas Paintings Painting Scarecrows Crafts Pallet Halloween Wood Paint Diy Autumn Painted Craft Easy Projects Twist Signs Ec0</span></a>
