However, some tips on how to draw a rainbow include using a light pencil to draw the colors in shades of yellow, orange, red, green, blue, indigo, and violet; using a watercolor or gouache brush to add texture and dimension; and using a graduated trowel or palette knife to create gradual changes in color.
rainbow
How to draw a rainbow. There are many ways to draw a rainbow, but the most common is the U-shape. First, start by drawing the colors in shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Next, add in the other colors as needed. For example, if you wanted to make a red and green band across the top of your paper, start with the colors in shades of red and green (or purple and yellow), then add in blue and indigo later. Finally, put any final touches on your rainbow by drawing reflections of each color on both sides of your paper.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/picture-wall-gallery-layout-ideas/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Picture Wall Gallery Layout Ideas - Kitchen Narrow Galley Functional Stylish Designs Super Kitchens Remodel Layout Modern Shaped Tiny Digsdigs Cozinha Space Area Idea Pequenas Apartment</span></a>
