One reason is that the resolution of your computer&rsquo;s monitor might not be high enough to show the detail in your artwork. Another reason is that the colors may not be as vibrant as they could be because they were captured at a lower resolution. Finally, some of the pixels in an image may have been missed due to low resolution or poor lighting.
There are a couple of reasons why digital art can look flat. One is that the software used to create the artwork doesn&rsquo;t give the artist much control over how it looks. Another reason is that the artists working with digital art often don&rsquo;t put in as much effort into making their work look good.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/tree-drawing-ideas-easy/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Tree Drawing Ideas Easy : Toucan Bird, Surrounded By Flowers, Palm Leaves, Two Butterflies</span></a>
