However, many experts feel that it&rsquo;s generally not normal for a 4-year-old to not sit still and focus on their activities.
Are 4 year olds normal? Some parents say yes, while others say no. The answer may depend on your child and the environment in which they are raised. Here is an overview of what some experts say about sitting still:
Some experts believe that 4 year olds are not usually as active as they used to be and may not be able to sit still for very long. This can lead to problems such as low energy or boredom. It is also important for them to learn how to regulate their body temperature, since sitting still all day can do this to them.
&ldquo;It has been shown that children who are not active generally have lower levels of serotonin, a mood-boosting hormone,&rdquo; said Dr. Mercola, a pediatrician in Tucson, Ariz." Serotonin is responsible for feelings of happiness and well-being.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/simple-disney-doodles/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Simple Disney Doodles - Bright Eyes And Beautiful Lies: Some Doodles</span></a>
