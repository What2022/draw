The 30 Day Drawing Challenge is a challenge where people draw something every day for 30 days. This can be anything that someone feels comfortable drawing, whether it is a picture, a simple sketch, or even just some pencils and paper. There are many different challenges out there, so it really depends on what someone is interested in. If someone wants to try something new and see if they like it, then the 30 Day Drawing Challenge is a great way to start off their drawing journey.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/photo-wall-gallery-ideas-pinterest/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Photo Wall Gallery Ideas Pinterest : Pinterest Apartment Bathroom Decor Ideas</span></a>
