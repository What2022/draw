Some lions are white, while others are black.
Lions are classified into three groups based on their color: brown, black, and yellow. Lions are mostly found in Africa, but they can be seen in other parts of the world as well. Lions have a brown mane and body, which can vary depending on the season. They have a yellow face and body, which is the most common color among them.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/cool-easy-art-paintings/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cool Easy Art Paintings ~ Magical Unicorn Print</span></a>
