Some people like to use a crayon or a pencil to start with, while others prefer drawing on paper. Once you have started, it is important to keep going!
How to start coloring? There is no one-size-fits-all answer, but some tips on how to start coloring can help you get started.
You can start by printing out a variety of coloring sheets or books. You can also find online color wheel generators or online resources that list various methods for starting coloring.
