A drawing is a form of visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium. Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human expression, with evidence dating back to pre-historic times. Today, drawings can be found in everything from the sketchpads of amateur artists to the final products of professional illustrators.
Though the definition of a drawing may seem simple, the act of drawing is complex and nuanced. Different types of drawings can achieve different effects, and there are an endless number of ways to approach the art form. For some, drawing is a way to capture an image or idea exactly as it appears in their mind. For others, it‚Äôs a more expressive process, using line and shape to create something that represents their inner thoughts and emotions.</p><h2 id=rainbow-sketch-2020--hippie-art-indie-drawings-art>Rainbow Sketch 2020 | Hippie Art, Indie Drawings, Art<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rainbow-sketch-2020--hippie-art-indie-drawings-art>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/be/e3/7f/bee37feae009521d74526494128ac2b0.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.YMyq9gqQnsy27kWfKNifYwHaJ3&pid=15.1"' alt="rainbow sketch 2020 | Hippie art, Indie drawings, Art"><p><em>Source: pinterest.pt</em></p><blockquote><p>doodles schizzi leinwand √§sthetische art1.</p></blockquote><h2 id=what-is-the-30-day-drawing-challenge>What Is The 30 Day Drawing Challenge?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-the-30-day-drawing-challenge>#</a></h2><p>The 30 Day Drawing Challenge is a challenge where you have to draw something within 30 days.
