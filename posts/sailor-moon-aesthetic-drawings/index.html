How to Color Art The Supplies You Will Need:
The supplies you will need to color your art are a few sheets of paper, crayons or colored pencils, an art supply box or bag, and a big piece of paper.
If you are using crayons, break them into small pieces so that they will not smear when you color. If you are using pencils, sharpen them by rubbing the eraser end on a hard surface.
Choose a piece of paper to work on. Place it on a flat surface so that the artwork will be level when you start coloring it. Draw a grid on the large piece of paper with lines at least 2 inches wide. Put the smaller pieces of paper in the grid so that they are evenly spaced.
Start by filling in some basic colors with your crayons or pencils.</p><h2 id=pin-by-serena-tsukino-on-„Ç¢„Éã„É°--sailor-moon-luna-sailor-moon-aesthetic>Pin By Serena Tsukino On „Ç¢„Éã„É° | Sailor Moon Luna, Sailor Moon Aesthetic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pin-by-serena-tsukino-on-„Ç¢„Éã„É°--sailor-moon-luna-sailor-moon-aesthetic>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/4b/2d/e7/4b2de7f008314a4e8a0c64a8dfb40e43.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.gEMHO6Z6IYLLiVFVykJnvgHaF7&pid=15.1"' alt="Pin by Serena Tsukino on „Ç¢„Éã„É° | Sailor moon luna, Sailor moon aesthetic"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>sailor moon luna cat aesthetic serena.</p></blockquote><p>How to do easy coloring?
There are many different ways to do easy coloring. You can use crayons, pencils, markers and paint. Here are 8 tips for easy coloring:</p><ol><li>Choose a color that you like and start drawing with a light hand. If the color is too strong, you can always add more later.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t overdo it - if your coloring is too intense, it will be hard to see the details in the picture.</li><li>Pay attention to the edges of your pictures - they often look better when colored in completely around them.</li><li>Use different colors to create interesting effects - blues and greens can create a ocean effect, for example, while reds and oranges can create flames or sunsets.</li><li></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/nature-beginners-simple-pencil-drawing-pictures/><span class=title>¬´ Prev</span><br><span>Nature Beginners Simple Pencil Drawing Pictures ~ Easy Nature Scenery Drawing For Beginners</span></a>
