Let your creativity flow and see where it takes you.</p><h2 id=bonnie-siracusa--murals--fine-art--gallery--self-portraits>Bonnie Siracusa | Murals – Fine Art | Gallery | Self Portraits<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bonnie-siracusa--murals--fine-art--gallery--self-portraits>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://bonniesiracusa.com/Gallery/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/The-4-Faces-of-Me-Colored-Pencil-on-Paper.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.pgbXMbP_CAvR995awjGFuAHaL3&pid=15.1"' alt="Bonnie Siracusa | Murals – Fine Art | Gallery | Self Portraits"><p><em>Source: bonniesiracusa.com</em></p><blockquote><p>pencil colored drawings paper self fine faces portraits paintings posted.</p></blockquote><p>Coloring is not just for kids anymore.
