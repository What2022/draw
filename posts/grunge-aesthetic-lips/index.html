One of the earliest known examples of a coloring page was created by Kate Greenaway, an English illustrator who’s famous for her children’s books. Greenaway’s coloring pages were intricate and detailed, often featuring flowers or other nature scenes.</p><p>It wasn’t until the 1950s that coloring pages really took off in popularity. This was thanks in part to Dr. Benjamin Spock, who wrote a bestselling parenting book that recommended using coloring pages as a way to calm and distract young children.</p><p>Today, there are more than 1 billion coloring pages printed each year, making it one of the most popular activities for both kids and adults.</p><h2 id=pin-by-lia-s-on-blu--dark-blue-wallpaper-blue-aesthetic-dark-blue>Pin By Lia S On BLU | Dark Blue Wallpaper, Blue Aesthetic Dark, Blue<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pin-by-lia-s-on-blu--dark-blue-wallpaper-blue-aesthetic-dark-blue>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/04/5c/ec/045cec0e4f54c5cc7b7da1c09840367e.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.8zhoJRDKvhs5n31G0zjkAwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Pin by Lia S on BLU | Dark blue wallpaper, Blue aesthetic dark, Blue"><p><em>Source: br.pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>darkblue enjpg nawpic guire frederick wachabuy journalwallpaperlyra.</p></blockquote><p>Art is a great way to express yourself and relieve stress.
