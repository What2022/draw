While most people know about Pennywise from the movie, there are also many variations of him that can be drawn. Here are 5 tips on how to draw Pennywise as effectively as possible:</p><ol><li>Start with a strong frontispiece to help define your character&rsquo;s features.</li><li>Use dark colors to create a menacing feeling.</li><li>Try to use movement and motion to add tension and excitement.</li><li>Use details sparingly so that your focus is on the main characters face and features.</li><li>Always use caution when drawing monsters, as they can be quite dangerous!</li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/color-pencil-artwork/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Color Pencil Artwork ~ 19-year-old Artist Draws Hyper-realistic Eyes Using Only Coloured</span></a>
