Once you have an idea of what you want your drawing to look like, use the Fill Tool to add color where needed. This will give your drawing a more realistic appearance.</p></li><li><p>To make sure that the fill tool is working correctly, experiment with different angles and sizes of the brush. Be sure not to overdo it - just use enough force so that the brush moves uniformly across all surfaces but don&rsquo;t overuse it or it will start moving too quickly and cause errors in your drawing.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=turkish-marbling-lesson-in-istanbulebru-marble-ebru-marble-marble>TURKISH MARBLING LESSON IN ISTANBUL,ebru, Marble, Ebru, Marble, Marble<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#turkish-marbling-lesson-in-istanbulebru-marble-ebru-marble-marble>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.istanbullife.org/ebru_set.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.T6gp1zHmKLLELw7Y4aYdzQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="TURKISH MARBLING LESSON IN ISTANBUL,ebru, marble, Ebru, Marble, Marble"><p><em>Source: istanbullife.org</em></p><blockquote><p>ebru turkish marbling pieces sets istanbul dye painting brush paper istanbullife lesson.</p></blockquote><p>A picture is worth a thousand words, and that saying has never been more true than it is today.
