Some people prefer to use a soft pencil for drawing the character&rsquo;s outline, while others prefer to use a hard pencil for more detailed lines and details.
There&rsquo;s something about Slender Man that just inspires people to create their own illustrations of the character. Whether it&rsquo;s a creative way to express yourself or just an interesting sketch to capture a moment, there&rsquo;s no wrong way to draw Slender Man. So, how do you go about drawing him? Here are four tips:</p><ol><li>Start by sketching out the basic outline of your character with pencil on paper. This will give you a strong foundation for painting your details on top.</li><li>Next, begin layering your paint according to what looks best on your canvas. For example, if you want to add more muscle tone, add thicker layers of paint over the pencil outline. If you want a more slender look, add thinner layers over the pencil outline and then blend using a brush or palette knife.</li><li></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/easy-bird-drawing-for-beginners/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easy Bird Drawing For Beginners : Painting Canvas Beginners Paintings Animals Abstract Watercolor Animal Easy Bird Birds Acrylic Beginner Rollins Paulie Things Flores Ilustração Pássaros Pencils</span></a>
