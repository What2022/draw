Once you know what you want to draw, sketch out a rough outline of the image. This doesn’t have to be perfect, but it will help you visualize the final product.
From there, begin fleshing out the details of your drawing. If you’re going for a cute and simple look, use light lines and avoid overly-complicated details. Keep the colors soft and muted, rather than using bright and bold hues. And lastly, don’t forget the finishing touches! A few well-placed hearts or stars can really make your drawing pop.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/boho-gallery-wall-set/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Boho Gallery Wall Set : Boho Teen Chic Adventure Awaits Bedroom Bohemian Decor Bedding Makeover Memehill Teenage Bedrooms Rooms Guitar Arrow Arrows Wood Diy Interior</span></a>
