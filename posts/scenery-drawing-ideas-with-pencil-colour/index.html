First, choose the right supplies. While you can color with anything from crayons to markers to colored pencils, there are certain supplies that will make your experience more enjoyable. Colored pencils are a good option because they allow for more precision than crayons and markers. They also come in a wide range of colors, so you can find the perfect shade for every picture.</p><p>Second, find a quiet place to relax. Coloring can be therapeutic, but only if you’re able to focus on the task at hand.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/fairy-aesthetic-art/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fairy Aesthetic Art : Y2k</span></a>
