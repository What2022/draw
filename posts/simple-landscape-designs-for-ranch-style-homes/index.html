When it comes to drawing, the planning phase is key to ensuring a successful composition. This is where you decide on the overall look and feel of your drawing, as well as the specific elements that you want to include.
Here are a few tips to help you plan your drawing:</p><ol><li><p>Decide on the purpose of your drawing. What are you trying to communicate? This will help you determine the overall tone and approach.</p></li><li><p>Sketch out a rough idea of what you want your drawing to look like. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, but it will give you a starting point.</p></li><li><p>Choose your colors carefully. Consider both the visual impact and the meaning of each color you use.</p></li><li><p>Pay attention to detail. The small details can make or break a drawing, so don&rsquo;t overlook them!</p></li><li></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/nature-simple-creative-drawing-ideas/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Nature Simple Creative Drawing Ideas - Collage Art Ideas For Kids</span></a>
