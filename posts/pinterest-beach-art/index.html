Adult coloring books are all the rage these days. But if you’ve never picked up a colored pencil in your life, where do you start? Here are a few tips to get you started on your adult coloring journey.
Before you start, take a look at the big picture. What colors will you use? What color scheme do you want to follow? Once you have an idea of the overall look you’re going for, it’s time to start filling in the details.</p><p>Start with the easy stuff. If there are any small areas that only require one or two colors, get those out of the way first. This will help build your confidence and give you a sense of accomplishment as you move on to the more difficult sections.</p><p>And speaking of difficult sections, don’t be afraid to ask for help.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/pinterest-art-sketches/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pinterest Art Sketches - Animatronicos Bastelarbeiten Pappe Mangle Fnafhs Fnaf6 Kunsttagebuch Dormitabis Ennard</span></a>
