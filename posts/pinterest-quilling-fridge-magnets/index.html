There are a few things you can do in order to create a realistic eye. One is to use a light pencil to sketch the features of the eye on your paper. Then, using a heavier pencil, draw the lines that form the pupil. Finally, use a light brush to fill in any dark circles or shadows around the pupil. When drawing a realistic eye, the first step is to know the basic anatomy of the eye. The iris is the yellow part of the eye that opens and closes, and it affects how light enters and exits the eye. The pupil is the black part of the eye and it’s responsible for seeing. Next, you need to decide on how you want your eye to look. You can choose to have a round or oval pupil. You can also choose to have a thin or thick iris, and you can also choose to have a high or low number of lashes. Finally, you need to decide on how much blurriness you want in your eyes. You can either set your eyes completely clear so that everything is sharp, or you can make them slightly blurry so that they look more realistic.\n","wordCount":"1334","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-07-14T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-07-14T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mina Casper"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/pinterest-quilling-fridge-magnets/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Draw Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://what2022.github.io/draw/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://what2022.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Pinterest Quilling Fridge Magnets - Anime Character</h1><div class=post-description>All about quilling: new cards for occasions</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-07-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>July 14, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1334 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Mina Casper</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#anime-character--paper-quilling-character-anime-characters>Anime Character | Paper Quilling, Character, Anime Characters</a></li><li><a href=#sushi-meals--paper-quilling-designs-quilling-quilling-paper-craft>Sushi Meals | Paper Quilling Designs, Quilling, Quilling Paper Craft</a></li><li><a href=#how-do-you-draw-jeff-the-killer>How Do You Draw Jeff The Killer?</a></li><li><a href=#all-about-quilling-photo-frames--quilled-photo-frame>All About Quilling: Photo Frames | Quilled Photo Frame</a></li><li><a href=#-yukahappyquilling--3d-quilled-food-searched-by-châu-khang--paper>© Yukahappyquilling- 3D Quilled Food (Searched By Châu Khang) | Paper</a></li><li><a href=#all-about-quilling-new-cards-for-occasions--handmade-cards--quilled>All About Quilling: New Cards For Occasions | Handmade Cards | Quilled</a></li><li><a href=#quilling-flowers-and-frame---diy-handmade-ideas>Quilling Flowers And Frame - DIY Handmade Ideas</a></li><li><a href=#how-do-artists-decide-what-to-paint>How Do Artists Decide What To Paint?</a></li><li><a href=#nupur-creatives-more-post-it-notes-fridge-magnets>Nupur Creatives: More Post-it-Notes Fridge Magnets</a></li><li><a href=#how-do-you-draw-granny>How Do You Draw Granny?</a></li><li><a href=#all-about-quilling-name-plates-with-quilling--quilled-name-plates>All About Quilling: Name Plates With Quilling | Quilled Name Plates</a></li><li><a href=#221-best-quilling-cats-images-on-pinterest--paper-quilling-quilling>221 Best Quilling-cats Images On Pinterest | Paper Quilling, Quilling</a></li><li><a href=#how-do-you-draw-a-realistic-eye>How Do You Draw A Realistic Eye?</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>If you&rsquo;re feeling stuck on what to draw, look no further!

One is to use a light pencil to sketch the features of the eye on your paper. Then, using a heavier pencil, draw the lines that form the pupil. Finally, use a light brush to fill in any dark circles or shadows around the pupil.
When drawing a realistic eye, the first step is to know the basic anatomy of the eye. The iris is the yellow part of the eye that opens and closes, and it affects how light enters and exits the eye. The pupil is the black part of the eye and it’s responsible for seeing. Next, you need to decide on how you want your eye to look. You can choose to have a round or oval pupil. You can also choose to have a thin or thick iris, and you can also choose to have a high or low number of lashes. Finally, you need to decide on how much blurriness you want in your eyes. You can either set your eyes completely clear so that everything is sharp, or you can make them slightly blurry so that they look more realistic.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/pencil-drawing-ideas-art/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pencil Drawing Ideas Art ~ 40 Easy Still Life Painting Ideas For Beginners</span></a>
