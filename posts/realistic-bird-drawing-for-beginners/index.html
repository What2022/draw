Line drawings are usually done with pencils, while tone and colored drawings are usually done with paints. All three types of drawings can be used for different purposes.
Line drawings are often used to sketch out ideas or to capture the essence of a subject without worrying about details. Tone drawings add dimension to a subject by adding shading, while colored drawings can be used to create realistic images or to add emotion to a scene.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/pencil-easy-drawing-doodle-art/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pencil Easy Drawing Doodle Art ~ How To Draw A Mandala</span></a>
