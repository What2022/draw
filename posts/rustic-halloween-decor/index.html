Humor is a difficult thing to define, but many people believe that there are some things that make something funny. For example, if someone makes a fool of themselves, that might be considered humorous. Another factor could be the timing of the humor. Say, for instance, you see a person walking down the street with their head down and their hands in their pockets. All of a sudden they start jumping up and down with excitement. This might be amusing to someone who is watching, but it would likely not be funny to someone who has just had their lunchidy crash on them. It&rsquo;s all about the context and how it is delivered.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/pinterest-drawing-ideas-easy/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pinterest Drawing Ideas Easy - Vsco Drawings Summer Vibes Drawing Cute Doodle Aesthetic Draw Doodles Notebook Sketches Journal Simple Journals Paintings</span></a>
