Whether we&rsquo;re scrolling through our social media feeds, watching TV, or even just walking down the street, we&rsquo;re constantly taking in visual information. With so much visual stimulation, it&rsquo;s no wonder that many people have taken up drawing as a way to relax and unwind.
Drawing is a great way to de-stress and focus on the present moment. When you&rsquo;re drawing, you can&rsquo;t be thinking about what you need to do next week or what happened yesterday. You&rsquo;re completely focused on the task at hand, which can help you to clear your mind and relax.
Not only is drawing a great way to relax, but it&rsquo;s also a great way to express yourself. If you&rsquo;re not a words person, drawing can be a great way to communicate your thoughts and feelings.</p><h2 id=happy-shepherd-by-kot-filemon--how-to-draw-fur-colored-pencils>Happy Shepherd By Kot-Filemon | How To Draw Fur, Colored Pencils<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#happy-shepherd-by-kot-filemon--how-to-draw-fur-colored-pencils>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/13/94/2f/13942f828213d0657ca3750609816fd0.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jTnwrgRxHI_rI2nwFWM9qgHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Happy Shepherd by Kot-Filemon | How to draw fur, Colored pencils"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>The different styles of anime
