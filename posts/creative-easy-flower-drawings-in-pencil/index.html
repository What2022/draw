One way is to use a filter. Another way is to use a layer style.
Adding color to depth can be achieved in several ways. One way is to use a tool called a Levels adjustment. This adjustment allows you to change the overall brightness and saturation of the image, making it look more like it was taken with a camera with more natural colors. Another way is to use an effect called bump mapping. Bump mapping lets you add color to areas that are not typically color-rich, such as the bottom of an image or near the edge of a photo.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/craftsman-style-interior-doors/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Craftsman Style Interior Doors ~ Craftsman Thecatskillfarms</span></a>
