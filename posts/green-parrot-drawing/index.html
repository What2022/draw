In 2020, humanity will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first human beings on earth. To commemorate this momentous event, we need to ask what color the year 2022 will be. A variety of experts believe that blue will be the new global color.</p><p>Some reasons why blue may become the new global color include:</p><ol><li>It is a strong and versatile color that can be used for a variety of purposes, including clothing and accessories, advertisements, logos, and iconography.</li><li>It is popular in Asia and South America where many people wear blue jeans, sunglasses, and other clothing items with nationalist or separatist messages.</li><li>Blue has been used as the symbol for the United Nations since its inception in 1945. This gives it some legitimacy as a global color choice.</li></ol><h2 id=learn-how-to-draw-a-princess-parrot-parrots-step-by-step--drawing>Learn How To Draw A Princess Parrot (Parrots) Step By Step : Drawing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#learn-how-to-draw-a-princess-parrot-parrots-step-by-step--drawing>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.drawingtutorials101.com/drawing-tutorials/Animals/Parrots/princess-parrot/how-to-draw-Princess-Parrot-step-8.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0NHrA6tUmkFK6P3BU0R8-wDSEp&pid=15.1"' alt="Learn How to Draw a Princess Parrot (Parrots) Step by Step : Drawing"><p><em>Source: drawingtutorials101.com</em></p><blockquote><p>parrot.</p></blockquote><h2 id=what-order-do-pencils-go-in>What Order Do Pencils Go In?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-order-do-pencils-go-in>#</a></h2><p>The order of pencils goes in the following order: lead, lead-point, graphite, black, white.
