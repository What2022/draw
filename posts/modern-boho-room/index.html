In a world where technology reigns supreme, it&rsquo;s easy to forget the power of a pencil and a piece of paper. But as any artist will tell you, drawing is an incredibly important part of the creative process.
There&rsquo;s something about putting pencil to paper that helps you slow down and really think about what you&rsquo;re creating. It forces you to be more intentional with your lines and shapes, and as a result, your drawings can end up being more expressive and complex than if you were just doodling on your phone.</p><p>Plus, learning how to draw can open up a whole new world of creativity. If you&rsquo;ve ever felt like you&rsquo;re not very good at art, give drawing a try - you might be surprised at what you&rsquo;re able to create.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/master-bedroom-makeover/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Master Bedroom Makeover : Do You Have Unattractive Louver Doors?
