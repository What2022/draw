Whether you&rsquo;re creating a coloring page for yourself or giving one as a gift, it&rsquo;s important to choose the right supplies and follow some basic tips for creating your masterpiece. Here are some guidelines to get you started:</p><ol><li><p>Choose a color palette that inspires you. When selecting colors, think about what mood or feeling you want your coloring page to evoke. For example, if you&rsquo;re creating a happy scene with flowers and sunshine, use colors like yellow, orange, and pink. If you&rsquo;re feeling dark and foreboding, use colors like black, brown, and navy blue.</p></li><li><p>Use shading and highlights to add depth and detail to your coloring pages. Shading is when light is applied at an angle to the paper; highlights are spots of light that stand out from the rest of the paper.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/hipster-animals/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Hipster Animals : Everyone Asks What Does The Fox Say, No One Asks How The Fox Feels</span></a>
