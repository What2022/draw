First, gather the necessary supplies: watercolor paper, a brush, and white paint. Be sure to test the paint on an inconspicuous area first to make sure it will not stain your paper.</p><p>Second, choose the right color for your flower. Purple is often used for irises and lavenders are popular for lilies. For more complicated flowers, experiment with different colors until you find one that works best.</p><p>Third, use small dots or dashes of color to create highlights and shadows on your petals. Finally, take time to finish each detail, such as the stem or leaves.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/bullet-journal-stickers-scrapbook-printable-flower-stickers/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Bullet Journal Stickers Scrapbook Printable Flower Stickers ~ Pin By Naomi .
