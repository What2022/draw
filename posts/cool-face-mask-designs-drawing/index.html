There is a popular belief that artists are born with the ability to draw. However, this is not always the case. Some people believe that artists are born with a love for drawing from an early age, while others may not have any skill in drawing until they reach a certain age. There is no right or wrong answer to this question, it simply depends on what someone’s personal definition of “drawing” is.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/colorful-green-parrot-drawing/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Colorful Green Parrot Drawing : Birds Pencil Colored Eastern Diane Wright Journal</span></a>
