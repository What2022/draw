One way is to use a pen with a different color. Another way is to use a drawing implement such as a eraser or sharpie.
Sketching isn&rsquo;t a one-time event. You&rsquo;ll need to keep your pencil sharp and maintain its color for years to come. Here are four ways to change the color of your pencil every time you use it:</p><ol><li><p>Use a non-permanent ink. permanent inks will cause the pen to write permanently in the paper. If you want to change the color of your pencil, you&rsquo;ll have to switch to a different permanent ink each time you use it.</p></li><li><p>Keep the lead fresh by shaking it occasionally. When you sharpen your pencil, make sure that there is plenty of lead left in the barrel so that it can be used again quickly.</p></li></ol><h2 id=easy-and-cute-doodle--художественные-журналы-артбуки-легкие-рисунки>Easy And Cute Doodle. | Художественные журналы, Артбуки, Легкие рисунки<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#easy-and-cute-doodle--художественные-журналы-артбуки-легкие-рисунки>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ba/dc/74/badc7454aa35d9ad849e509196d4633e.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.6WUJJnRG5gwY5whZywIq2QHaJ3&pid=15.1"' alt="Easy and cute doodle. | Художественные журналы, Артбуки, Легкие рисунки"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Where to find coloring pages: Free printable coloring pages can be found online
