Use an orange handle or flesh tone for the lower lip, while brown or black for the upper lip and chin.</p></li><li><p>Finally, use texture to give your lips a realistic appearance.

Drawing pictures can be a form of relaxation. It can help take your mind off of stressors and clear your head. Drawing can also be a form of self-expression and can help you communicate your feelings when you don&rsquo;t have the words to express them.
If you&rsquo;re feeling stressed or overwhelmed, try spending some time drawing. Pick up a pencil and paper, or grab your tablet or phone, and start doodling. See where your imagination takes you and let yourself relax into the process. You might be surprised at how therapeutic it can be.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/sad-drawings-tumblr/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Sad Drawings Tumblr - Ufos On Tumblr</span></a>
