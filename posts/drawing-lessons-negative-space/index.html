Rainbow girls are one of the most popular designs in the world, and with good reason. They&rsquo;re simple, fun, and easy to draw. Here&rsquo;s how to create a high rainbow girl:</p><ol><li><p>Begin by sketching out your basic outline of your character. This will help you get a sense for her proportions and how she should look overall.</p></li><li><p>Next, add in any details that you want to include in your rainbow girl design. Eyes, hair, skin&mldr; anything that you feel needs to be represented in your drawing. You can also focus on making her pose or looking happy or sad depending on your desired effect.</p></li><li><p>Finally, add in the colors that will make up your high rainbow girl design! Choose a range of bright, vibrant colors that will show off your character&rsquo;s personality well.</p></li></ol><h2 id=negative-space-art-visual-art-lessons-space-art-projects>Negative Space Art, Visual Art Lessons, Space Art Projects<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#negative-space-art-visual-art-lessons-space-art-projects>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7d/ee/2e/7dee2ef3f6521d0bdd74a7c02b71323f--art-handouts-art-worksheets.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0AY2euaBERllyocTP71sGQHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="Negative space art, Visual art lessons, Space art projects"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>space negative lesson drawing lessons worksheets visual elementary.</p></blockquote><h2 id=how-do-i-fill-color-in-sketchbook>How Do I Fill Color In Sketchbook?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-do-i-fill-color-in-sketchbook>#</a></h2><p>There are a few ways to fill in sketches in a sketchbook.
