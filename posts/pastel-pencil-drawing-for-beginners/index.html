Drawing has always been a passion of mine. As a child, I would often spend hours lost in my own world, drawing whatever came to mind. To this day, drawing is still one of my favorite pastimes. It&rsquo;s a way for me to relax and escape from the stresses of everyday life.
When I sit down to draw, I enter into my own little world where anything is possible. I can let my imagination run wild and create whatever I want. It&rsquo;s a form of self-expression that allows me to be whoever I want to be, without judgement from anyone else. That&rsquo;s what drawing means to me.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/modern-farmhouse-wall-decor-ideas/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Modern Farmhouse Wall Decor Ideas ~ Shower Wood Tile Bathroom Rustic Master Bathrooms Custom Designs</span></a>
