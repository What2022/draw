If you&rsquo;re looking to add a little color to your flowers, there are a few different ways you can do it. One way is to use food coloring. You can add a few drops of food coloring to the water when you&rsquo;re watering your plants, and it will seep up into the flowers and change their color. Another way to color your flowers is by using spray paint. This method works best if you have white or light-colored flowers. Just make sure to use painters tape to cover any areas that you don&rsquo;t want painted, and be sure to do it in a well-ventilated area. You can also buy colored flower petals at some craft stores, which can be used to make your own colored flower arrangements.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/easy-pointillism-drawings/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easy Pointillism Drawings : Untitled In 2020</span></a>
