When it comes to coloring, most people think of the three primary colors: red, yellow, and blue. But there is a fourth color that is just as important: white.

That&rsquo;s why when you add white to a color, it make it brighter.</p><p>So next time you&rsquo;re reaching for that box of crayons, don&rsquo;t forget about white! It might not be as exciting as some of the other colors, but it&rsquo;s an essential part of any masterpiece.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/aesthetic-wallpaper-to-draw/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Aesthetic Wallpaper To Draw ~ Texture Idesigniphone</span></a>
