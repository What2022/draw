Kissy Missy was always around to help out her friends. She would go out of her way to help them out and she was always there for a smile. However, what may have started as a friendly act ended up biting the girls in the butt when they got older. For one, Kissy Missy helped by telling them what to do and how to behave. Additionally, she would often use her influence to get things done that other people didn&rsquo;t even want to think of. Lastly, KissyMissy often helped with other projects that were on the horizon but were too difficult or too risky for others.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/garage-door-as-window/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Garage Door As Window : Garage Apartment Modular Shed Roof Overhang Contemporary Farmhouse Pleasing</span></a>
