A 2B pencil is an especially versatile tool used by students in school and at work. They are used to make calculations and writing, as well as drawing on paper. Pencils have a lead point and a eraser end. The lead end is sharpened and used to draw lines on paper. The eraser end is used to erase the lines made with the lead end.</p><h2 id=big-eye-sun-simple-hand-drawing-black-and-white-stock-vector>Big Eye Sun Simple Hand Drawing Black And White Stock Vector<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#big-eye-sun-simple-hand-drawing-black-and-white-stock-vector>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/big-eye-sun-simple-hand-drawing-black-white-10186121.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.3jUiqga4VTmd2yu3IzKA_wHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Big Eye Sun Simple Hand Drawing Black And White Stock Vector"><p><em>Source: dreamstime.com</em></p><blockquote><p>simple drawing sun hand eye moon drawings dreamstime illustration rocks easy vector nose mouth rock painted background moons suns eyes.</p></blockquote><p>Everyone can draw.
