How do beginners start drawing? There is no one answer to this question as it depends on the individual. However, some tips that may help include: 1) reconnaissance: Beginners should take a look at how others draw in order to learn how to do the same. This can be done by watching tutorials or reading articles about drawing. 2) practice: If someone tells you that you need to practice for 3 months before you can start drawing, they are likely right. Practice makes perfect!
