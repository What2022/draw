Love is a spectrum, and each person experiences it differently. Some people may feel passion in the red range, warmth in orange, caring in yellow, hope in green, peace in blue, and trust in indigo. Other people may experience love at different points on the spectrum depending on their individual needs and desires. No one way of experiencing love is better than any other; each person should find what works best for them.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/printable-unicorn-string-art-template/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Printable Unicorn String Art Template ~ Dala Horse Pattern.
