One way is to use a fast drawing tool like a eraser or pencil. Another way is to use a quick guide line.
Do you ever feel like your sketching skills are slowly deteriorating? If so, you&rsquo;re not alone. Many students feel that they can&rsquo;t seem to produce accurate sketches in a timely manner. This is a common problem for beginners, and it can be difficult to overcome. Here are some tips on how to improve your speed and accuracy while Sketching:</p><ol><li><p>Practice more often than you think necessary. After all, if you&rsquo;re not constantly practicing, your sketches will eventually become stale and less accurate.</p></li><li><p>Use the correct tools for the task at hand. For example, if you&rsquo;re drawing someone&rsquo;s face in a Sketch application, use a brush or other soft object to help erase mistakes quickly.</p></li><li><p>Be patient when creating sketches. If it feels like taking forever to complete a sketch, don&rsquo;t be discouraged; just keep working until everything looks good.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/landscape-drawing-techniques/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Landscape Drawing Techniques - Cool Nature Desktop Views Amazing Backgrounds Landscape Digital Wallpapers Mountain Waterfall Pixelstalk River Wallup</span></a>
