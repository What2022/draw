Children can sit still for extended periods of time if they are supervised and have someone to give them exercises to keep them comfortable. However, some children may need breaks every few minutes or hours. For infants and young children, sitting in a lapside position is the best way to stay still.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/women-drawing-face-sketch/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Women Drawing Face Sketch : Abstract Expressionist Drawing Of Woman Face Portrait 602642 Vector Art</span></a>
