Whether we&rsquo;re scrolling through our social media feeds, watching TV, or even just walking down the street, we&rsquo;re constantly taking in visual information. With so much visual stimulation, it&rsquo;s no wonder that many people have taken up drawing as a way to relax and unwind.
Drawing is a great way to de-stress and focus on the present moment. When you&rsquo;re drawing, you can&rsquo;t be thinking about what you need to do next week or what happened yesterday. You&rsquo;re completely focused on the task at hand, which can help you to clear your mind and relax.
Not only is drawing a great way to relax, but it&rsquo;s also a great way to express yourself. If you&rsquo;re not a words person, drawing can be a great way to communicate your thoughts and feelings.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/hipster-artisan/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Hipster Artisan - Monti Rome Neighbourhood</span></a>
