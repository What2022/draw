But soon enough, the cups turned into Disaster Cups, as people would dump their contents all over themselves in a mess. In 2001, the company was fined $8 million for violating consumer safety laws. And though it&rsquo;s not clear why Huggy Wuggy went evil, it may have been due to the cups&rsquo; popularity and the fact that they were easy to make and share.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/garage-door-material-options/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Garage Door Material Options ~ Garage Rv Boat Storage Plans Houseplansandmore Barn Plan Drawings Kira Apartment 059d Floor Accurate Refer Vary Slightly Architect Layout Copyright</span></a>
