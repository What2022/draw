In the early 2000s, a company called Huggy Wuggy was making Huggy Wugs, which were small plastic cups that were meant to be shared with friends. But soon enough, the cups turned into Disaster Cups, as people would dump their contents all over themselves in a mess. In 2001, the company was fined $8 million for violating consumer safety laws. And though it&rsquo;s not clear why Huggy Wuggy went evil, it may have been due to the cups&rsquo; popularity and the fact that they were easy to make and share.</p><h2 id=this-artist-was-told-to-give-up-drawing-cats-but-that-didn039t-stop-them>This Artist Was Told To Give Up Drawing Cats, But That Didn't Stop Them<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#this-artist-was-told-to-give-up-drawing-cats-but-that-didn039t-stop-them>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a2/75/94/a275942d7a9442dd80d51296241adfef.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tIzgNm2bzKsdfwij69xtSAHaLX&pid=15.1"' alt="This Artist Was Told to Give up Drawing Cats, but That Didn't Stop Them"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>blazepress.</p></blockquote><ol start=3><li>Coloring can help children relax
According to a study done by the Department of Psychology at the University of Sheffield, coloring can help children relax. The study found that children who were given coloring books and crayons felt more relaxed than those who were given other types of toys.
This is likely because coloring allows children to focus on one thing and tune out everything else. It’s a form of mindfulness that can help kids stay in the present moment and avoid worry about the future or ruminating on the past.</li></ol><p>So next time your child is feeling anxious or stressed, break out the crayons and let them color to their heart’s content. It just might be the relaxation they need.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/easy-doodles-cute-aesthetic-draw/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easy Doodles Cute Aesthetic Draw ~ Sac Pasatiempos Sopa Letras</span></a>
