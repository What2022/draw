Drawings are one of the oldest forms of human expression, dating back to the days when our ancestors first began using cave walls as canvases.

Today, drawings continue to play an important role in our lives, whether we’re doodling in a notebook or creating a work of art.
Let’s take a look at the history of drawings, starting with some of the earliest examples that have been found. One of the oldest-known drawings is a Chauvet Cave painting that depicts two animals – believed to be a rhinoceros and a lion – locked in combat. This drawing, which is thought to date back 32,000 years, is significant not only for its age but also for its level of detail and realism.</p><h2 id=15-beautiful-easy-drawing-ideas--beautiful-easy-drawings-easy>15 Beautiful Easy Drawing Ideas | Beautiful Easy Drawings, Easy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#15-beautiful-easy-drawing-ideas--beautiful-easy-drawings-easy>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/df/14/09df1486d290abe74fc6f3d0bb112eae.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cYhj-5R4xH9hHJ23q-XrbQHaKO&pid=15.1"' alt="15 Beautiful Easy Drawing Ideas | Beautiful easy drawings, Easy"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>zeichenideen shihoriobata doodles.</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an activity to relax your mind, coloring may be just the thing.
