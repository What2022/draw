How do you draw hair? There are a few different ways to do it, but the most common way is to use a pencil. First, start by drawing the hair on your forehead and other parts of your head using a light line. Then, use darker lines to draw the hair down over your face and neck. For women, it is often better to draw their hair in a straight line like this: across their forehead, down their back, and then around each side of their neck. For men, it is often better to curl their hair around an angle or use a wave design.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/golden-eagle-head-drawings/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Golden Eagle Head Drawings : Bald Eagle Head</span></a>
