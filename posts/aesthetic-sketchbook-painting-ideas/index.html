There are numerous examples of funny coloring. For example, one person might choose to dye their hair green and call it “The Hulk’s Hair Color”. Another person might take the time to color their entire body blue, complete with accessories like sunglasses and a cape. And then there are the people who simply enjoy adding fun elements to everything they do – whether that’s wearing silly clothes or opting for brightly-colored hair dye.</p><p>No matter what your sense of humor is, there’s likely someone out there who shares it in some form or another.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/unicorn-string-art-template-printable/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Unicorn String Art Template Printable : Goss Bacheca Fadenbilder</span></a>
