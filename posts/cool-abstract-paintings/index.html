Drawing Thanos, the Titan of Time, can be an arduous task. To create an accurate, lifelike portrayal of the character, it takes a lot of practice and knowledge. Here are five tips to help you get started:</p><ol><li><p>Start by sketching out your basic design concepts.

You&rsquo;ll need a good variety of colors and tones to create a realistic effect for Thanos.</p></li><li><p>Finally, it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to details like the positioning of his fingers and toes.
