Applying the colors is the third and final step in coloring flowers. This is where you will use your chosen colors to add detail and depth to your flowers.
To start, you will need two colors of lightfast ink, a small brush, and a piece of watercolor paper. Begin by mixing a small amount of each color on a palette or plate. Pick up some of the lighter color with your brush and paint it onto the paper. Then, using a slightly dampened brush, pick up some of the darker color and paint it over the top of the lighter color. Work in small sections and build up the colors slowly.</p><p>Once you have applied the colors, allow them to dry completely before moving on to the next step. When done properly, this technique will result in beautiful, vibrant flowers that have depth and dimension.</p><h2 id=pin-by-akira-ryokotski-on-art--cool-easy-drawings-cute-easy-drawings>Pin By Akira Ryokotski On Art | Cool Easy Drawings, Cute Easy Drawings<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pin-by-akira-ryokotski-on-art--cool-easy-drawings-cute-easy-drawings>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3e/c1/f6/3ec1f62d88102351c3aefe3e7168de68--cute-drawings-of-love-simple-pencil-drawings.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.JKw_Bk7_xjQenjTpfjEZeAHaNK&pid=15.1"' alt="Pin by Akira Ryokotski on Art | Cool easy drawings, Cute easy drawings"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>pencil drawings cute drawing simple scary easy cool sketches creepy emo cartoon рисунки doll paintings выбрать доску akira.</p></blockquote><p>Coloring isn&rsquo;t just for kids anymore.
