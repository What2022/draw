What color is opposite of blue?
There are many different colors that are opposite of blue, but the two most common are green and yellow. Green is the color next to blue on the color wheel, and it&rsquo;s typically used as a rival for the hue of blue.</p><p>The opposite of yellow is orange, which is typically used in dishes like oranges and grapefruit. Orange also has a similar hue to green on the color wheel, so it can be confused with yellow when looking at things like this.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/drawing-ideas-with-pencil/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Drawing Ideas With Pencil ~ York Drawing Winter Wiltshire Stephen Imaginary Drawings Prints Sketch Draw Nyc Sketches Street Newyork Artist Pen Night Pencil Architectural Mbe</span></a>
