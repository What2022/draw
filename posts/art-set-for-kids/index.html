How to do the coloring? Here are 8 tips on how to get the perfect flower coloring for your projects: 1. Start with a sketch or plan of the flowers you want to create. This will help you determine the colors and shades that will be used.
2. Choose colors that compliment one another and work from there. If you are using more than two colors, it is important to test out different hues in a small area first so that everything looks consistent when finished.
3. Paint each petal with a separate color, allowing the background color to show through. Once all petals are painted, use a brush or sponge to fill any gaps and edges in between petals with a light touch.
4. Be patient while painting - mistakes can be fixed with a little bit of patience and practice!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/walt-disney-drawing-bambi/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Walt Disney Drawing Bambi : Bambi Clip Art</span></a>
