Most children start out coloring within the lines. But as they become more confident, they may experiment with different colors and techniques. Some children prefer to color very precisely, while others like to use large strokes or mix different colors together.</li></ol><p>There is no &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to color.

However, some pencils are softer than others. The softest pencils are those that are made from lead that is soft and easily breaks down.
The softest pencils are those made of natural lead. They are also the most expensive. However, they offer the best performance because they don&rsquo;t harden over time and can be used for more than one job. If you want the softest pencil possible, buy a natural lead one.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/african-animal-drawings/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>African Animal Drawings : Dodo Kratts Extinct Fandom</span></a>
