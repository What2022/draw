Coloring books were first published in the early 1800s. At that time, children used crayons and watercolors to create drawings and paintings. Prior to this, coloring was done with natural dyes such as madder, henna, and safflower.
In 1892, a kindergarten teacher named Maria Montessori introduced the concept of “activity coloring”. This involved letting the children use their hands and imaginations to color pictures on paper. This method became popular in Europe and eventually made its way to America.</p><p>The popularity of coloring eventually led to an industry that generates billions of dollars each year. Today, coloring books are available in every genre imaginable, from animals to superheroes. And no matter what your age or interests may be, there’s bound to be a coloring book that perfectly matches your needs!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/planet-tattoo-outline/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Planet Tattoo Outline : Space Clipart Liked On Polyvore Featuring Fillers, Doodles, Drawings</span></a>
