A drawing can be a work of art on its own, or it can be used as a preliminary sketch for another piece of art, such as a painting or sculpture. Drawing is also used in architecture, mapmaking, and scientific illustration. The medium of drawing refers to the type of support that the artist uses. The most common types of drawing medium are pencil, pen and ink, charcoal, pastel, and marker.</p><h2 id=diy-vsco-aesthetic-prints-painting--diy-canvas-art-painting-diy-art>DIY VSCO Aesthetic Prints Painting | Diy Canvas Art Painting, Diy Art<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#diy-vsco-aesthetic-prints-painting--diy-canvas-art-painting-diy-art>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/3d/cb/12/3dcb12a109f6d1ad1d9af539ced06bbc.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.iqWw5mc-sPaheHApjwpbEAHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="DIY VSCO aesthetic prints painting | Diy canvas art painting, Diy art"><p><em>Source: in.pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>In drawing, one makes a mark on a surface by applying pressure from a tool or moving a tool across a surface. Drawing is distinguished from painting by its focus on line rather than mass and surface. The activity of drawing is often exploratory, with emphasis on observation, problem-solving and composition. All sculpture is essentially made by the same means as drawing, but three-dimensional work calls for the addition of modeling, joining and firing processes.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/pinterest-art-projects-ideas/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Pinterest Art Projects Ideas : 19 Truly Fascinating Diy Garden Art Ideas You Never Thought Of</span></a>
