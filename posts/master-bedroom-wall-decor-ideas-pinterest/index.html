There are a variety of materials that can be used for drawing. Pencils are the most common, and come in a range of hardness from very soft to very hard. They can produce a wide variety of line thickness, from very fine to very thick.
Pens are also popular for drawing, and like pencils, come in a range of widths and hardness. They can be used for both fine lines and broad strokes.</p><p>Ink is another material that can be used for drawing. It has a tendency to bleed, so it&rsquo;s not ideal for precise lines, but it can produce rich, dark tones.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/cute-drawings-of-flowers/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cute Drawings Of Flowers ~ Rearing Horse Drawing</span></a>
