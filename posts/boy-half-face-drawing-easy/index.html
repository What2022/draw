Draw the image you want to trace on the sheet of paper.2. Use a pencil to draw a line across the top of the image.3. Use a ruler to draw a line down the center of the image.4. Use a white pencil to trace around the outside of the lines traced in step 3 and 4.
Tracing an image in a sketchbook can be a fun way to keep track of your progress and make sure you are always following the same design process. There are a few different ways to trace an image, but the most common is to use a tracing paper and use a straight edge to draw out the outline of the image.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/beautiful-nature-scenery-pencil-drawings/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Beautiful Nature Scenery Pencil Drawings ~ Head Of The Meadow Beach.
