Some people might prefer to use a softer, more gentle approach while others might prefer to go for a more aggressive style. Ultimately, the key is to be creative and come up with something that feels natural and organic.
Disney’s latest release, “Frozen,” has left many fans with a new appreciation for the character Elsa. To help those who want to learn how to draw Elsa from Frozen, here are five tips that can be applied in order to create a more realistic and lifelike Elsa.</p><ol><li><p>Start by observing the character&rsquo;s posture and body language in order to understand how she should appear on paper. For example, if Elsa is sitting down, she should be leaning back slightly so that her back is against the wall or the desk.</p></li><li><p>Next, begin by drawing her hair starting at her forehead and working your way down to her neck. Make sure it is soft and undyed so that it flows freely when drawn; use light strokes rather than hard ones to create movement.</p></li><li></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/realistic-pencil-drawings-cat/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Realistic Pencil Drawings Cat : Drawings Pencil Realistic Insane Sketches Pet Drawing Photorealistic Cat Paper Charcoal Illustrations Cats Hard Paul Lung Similar Graphite Portrait</span></a>
