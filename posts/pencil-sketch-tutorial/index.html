Start by finding a subject that interests you. It could be a still life, a landscape, or a person. Once you have found your subject, start by sketching it lightly in pencil. Pay attention to the basic shapes and proportions of the subject. Once you have the basic outline of the subject, start adding details. Work slowly and carefully, paying attention to light and shadow. Erase any unwanted lines as you go. When you are finished, take a step back and look at your drawing. Make any final adjustments that you think are necessary.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/halloween-window-decorating-ideas/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Halloween Window Decorating Ideas : Stationary Window Designs, 20 Window Decorating Ideas With Glass Shelves</span></a>
