Drawing is a form of visual communication, and the history of drawing is therefore long and complex. The earliest known drawings date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, some 30,000 years ago. It is believed that early humans drew primarily for functional purposes, such as mapping out hunting grounds or depicting animals for trophies.
As human societies evolved, drawing became increasingly stylized and decorative. By the time of the Renaissance in Europe, drawing had become an essential skill for artists who wished to realistically depict the world around them. In the modern era, drawing continues to be an important part of both art and design.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/sliding-garage-door-screens/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Sliding Garage Door Screens - 55 Reference Of Pella Lifestyle Double Sliding Door Contemporary In</span></a>
