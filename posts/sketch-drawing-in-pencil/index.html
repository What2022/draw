One reason is that your muscles are contracting and relaxing too quickly due to the excitement of the activity. Another reason could be that you have an irregular heartbeat which can cause your blood vessels to spasm and make your hand shake. Finally, if you have a lot of arthritis in your hands, it might be causing the muscles to contract and relax too slowly which can lead to hand shake.
Almost anyone can tell that their hand is shaky when they draw. This problem is often called “paprika hand” and it occurs when the tendons in the fingers are tight and the nerves aren’t getting enough stimulation. The lack of circulation can cause your muscles to become weak, which makes it difficult to keep your grip on the pen or paper.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/poppy-colours/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Poppy Colours - Tower Clock Makkah Royal Building Saudi Height</span></a>
