The key is to have a good lip line and use a light pencil to draw the outline of your lips. Then, use a heavier pencil to add in the color.
Drawing lips is a difficult task that takes practice. However, there are some steps that can help make it easier. Here are four tips:</p><ol><li><p>Start by drawing the outline of the lips. This will help you create a basic shape for your lips.</p></li><li><p>Next, fill in the rest of the lip dough with a light color. This will give your lips a natural look and feel.</p></li><li><p>Finally, use a dark color to finish off your lips and give them an Antiqued Look.</p></li></ol><h2 id=amazingly-realistic-pencil-drawings-and-portraits--vuingcom>Amazingly Realistic Pencil Drawings And Portraits – Vuing.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#amazingly-realistic-pencil-drawings-and-portraits--vuingcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://vuing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/super-hyper-realistic-pencil-portraits-drawings-pictures-2.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.JmqjHBh6jtKzTy7HPM63nAHaKH&pid=15.1"' alt="Amazingly realistic pencil drawings and portraits – Vuing.com"><p><em>Source: vuing.com</em></p><blockquote><p>pencil realistic drawings olga melamory larionova sketches portraits havok davey drawing super hyper artist sketch portrait awesome draw soul windows.</p></blockquote><p>Now, there&rsquo;s a new trend of adult coloring books.
