Remember that practice makes perfect, so keep at it and never give up.</p><p>One day, you&rsquo;ll look back at your old drawings and see how far you&rsquo;ve come. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how much better you are now than when you first started out. So keep going, and never give up on your dreams of becoming a great artist.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/cool-eye-art/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Cool Eye Art - Astonishing Movie Art Concepts By Peter Popken</span></a>
