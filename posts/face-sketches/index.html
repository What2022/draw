Some people prefer to color with pencils, while others prefer to use markers. Ultimately, what matters most is the person&rsquo;s preferred method of coloring.
A recent study has broken down the pros and cons of using pencils or markers to color. The study, which was conducted by The Economist, found that when it comes to details, pencils are better than markers. However, when it comes to overall color selection, Markers are better than pencils.
The Economist’s findings come as no surprise, as many people prefer the comfort of pencils over the precision of markers. For example, a person who wants to add a little shading to an image with pencils may find it more comfortable and easier to hold the pen in one hand while drawing. Additionally, pencils are more affordable than markers, making them a good choice for beginner artists or anyone on a budget.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/drawing-ideas-cute-easy-doodle-art-for-beginners/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Drawing Ideas Cute Easy Doodle Art For Beginners - Petit Cahier Pluma Gribouillages Artistiques Favim</span></a>
