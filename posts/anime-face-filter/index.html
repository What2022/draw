Here are some key factors to consider:</p><p>-The darkness or lightness of your image. A lighter image will require a darker pencil, while a darker image will require a lighter pencil.
-The shape of the pen tip. Somepencils have different tips that allow for more or less shading. This can be helpful if you want to create shaded areas with greater precision.
-The material the paper is written on. A drawing paper will generally absorb more color than a white piece of paper, so it may require a different type of pencil to shade correctly on this type of paper.</p><h2 id=2311826---safe-artistscorpdk-bright-eyes-diamond-tiara-human>#2311826 - Safe, Artist:scorpdk, Bright Eyes, Diamond Tiara, Human<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2311826---safe-artistscorpdk-bright-eyes-diamond-tiara-human>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://derpicdn.net/img/2020/4/2/2311826/large.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.enPW3hyOK38zsHPSVbh42AHaMO&pid=15.1"' alt="#2311826 - safe, artist:scorpdk, bright eyes, diamond tiara, human"><p><em>Source: derpibooru.org</em></p><blockquote><p>scorpdk.</p></blockquote><p>Drawing is a form of visual art in which a person uses various drawing instruments to mark paper or another two-dimensional medium.

There are a variety of drawing pencils, charcoals, pastels, etc. that an artist can use to create their work. Each type has its own unique properties that can produce different results.
Drawing pencils come in a range of hardness, from very soft to very hard. The harder the pencil, the darker and more precise the line will be. softer pencils are good for shading and blending.</p><p>Charcoal is made from burning wood or other organic materials. It comes in varying degrees of hardness, from very soft to very hard. Harder charcoals produce a darker line, while softer charcoals are good for shading and blending.</p><p>Pastels are made from ground pigments mixed with a binder.
