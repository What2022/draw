As we grow older and face the inevitable reality of getting a little bit grayer, our love for cute coloring will only intensify. Adults everywhere enjoy coloring in adorable pictures of animals and flowers, but why is it that some people can get lost in a rainbow of color while others find themselves staring at a black page for hours on end? The answer may come from one simple word: happiness. According to studies done by the University of Utah, adults who are happiest tend to be those who fill their lives with activities that make them happy. What better way to do that than by spending time coloring in cute pictures? Whether you’re an adult just starting out on your journey to happiness or you’ve been coloring for years, there are plenty of ways to get involved in the fun.</p><h2 id=md08-wallpaper-galaxy-eye-space-stars-color---papersco>Md08-wallpaper-galaxy-eye-space-stars-color - Papers.co<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#md08-wallpaper-galaxy-eye-space-stars-color---papersco>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://papers.co/wallpaper/papers.co-md08-wallpaper-galaxy-eye-space-stars-color-36-3840x2400-4k-wallpaper.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.w_OiZWFoOtE4oPSHhxGArwHaEo&pid=15.1"' alt="md08-wallpaper-galaxy-eye-space-stars-color - Papers.co"><p><em>Source: papers.co</em></p><blockquote><p>galaxy space eye stars 3840 md08 4k macbook pro 2160 papers 1600 2400 imac.</p></blockquote><p>What is coloring page?
