First, there is the basic problem of hand eye coordination. Second, the muscles that make up the face and body are very large and require a lot of strength to do them correctly. Third, the line of sight is often difficult to follow, which can lead to mistakes. Finally, drawing can be very time-consuming and require practice on a regular basis.
There are many reasons whyDrawing can be so hard. One reason is that it is a skillset that is often learned through experience and practice. Experience also helps to develop specific muscles that help with drawing, which can make the task even more difficult. Additionally, it can be difficult to keep a consistent pace when drawing, which can lead to a lapse in concentration.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/mother-nature-drawing-pencil/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Mother Nature Drawing Pencil ~ Big Image</span></a>
