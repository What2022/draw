Different people see different colors depending on what light they are in, how their eyes work, and what environment they are in.
According to a recent study, humans see colors best in shades of blue and purple. The study was conducted by the University of Utah and found that the colorblind individuals who participated were more likely to categorize objects as red, green, yellow, or blue based on their light sensitivity rather than their eyesight. This suggests that humans use different senses to see colors differently than those with normal vision.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/easy-art-drawing-for-beginners/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easy Art Drawing For Beginners : Christmas Paintings Canvas Snow Stunning Silent</span></a>
