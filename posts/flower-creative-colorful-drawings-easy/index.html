There are a few ways to shade a drawing correctly. One way is to use a lightening bolt. Another way is to use a practice drawing. You can also shade the drawing by using different color pencils and paper, or even light and dark shadows.</p><h2 id=best-markers-for-drawing-doodling-and-coloring--marker-drawing>Best Markers For Drawing, Doodling And Coloring | Marker Drawing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#best-markers-for-drawing-doodling-and-coloring--marker-drawing>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b3/02/77/b302771fcd768497d00204ad18f73753.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.pLwgw0yhQVL1XxDOMnJJEwHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Best Markers for Drawing, Doodling and Coloring | Marker drawing"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>marker sharpie doodling colormadehappy.</p></blockquote><p>The history of drawings
Drawings are one of the oldest forms of human expression, dating back to the days when our ancestors first began using cave walls as canvases. Over the millennia, drawings have been used for everything from communicating ideas and stories to documenting history and recording events. Today, drawings continue to play an important role in our lives, whether we’re doodling in a notebook or creating a work of art.
Let’s take a look at the history of drawings, starting with some of the earliest examples that have been found. One of the oldest-known drawings is a Chauvet Cave painting that depicts two animals – believed to be a rhinoceros and a lion – locked in combat. This drawing, which is thought to date back 32,000 years, is significant not only for its age but also for its level of detail and realism.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/best-drawing-ideas-with-pencil-colour/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Best Drawing Ideas With Pencil Colour : The Best Felt Tip Pens For Sketching Plants</span></a>
