However, some tips that may help include practicing with a variety of shading techniques, using light and dark tones to create depth, and using brushes and other tools to create realistic results.
Some digital artists prefer to use a shading method that is known as &ldquo;doubling&rdquo; or &ldquo;triple-shot.&ldquo;Doubling works by duplicating the colors of one image into two or three different images, then blending these together to create a more realistic shading effect. Triple-shot shading is similar, but rather than duplicating the colors, it creates three separate images with different color tones and then blends them together to create an overall shade. There are many different ways to get better at shading in digital art, so it&rsquo;s important to find the right method for you and your style.</p><h2 id=object-heads-object-heads-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see-feel-free-to>OBJECT HEADS.
