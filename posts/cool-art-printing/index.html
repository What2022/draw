To many parents, the act of coloring in a child&rsquo;s picture book is synonymous with calm and relaxation. However, recent studies have shown that the benefits to children of coloring are far greater than initially thought. According to a study published in the journal &ldquo;Pediatrics&rdquo;, children who engage in coloring often show increased focus, creativity, and productivity. These benefits can be seen as early as age 4 and continue into adulthood.
Interestingly enough, it has also been shown that coloring can help reduce stress levels in adults.

Start with a Color Scheme
Before starting to color, it&rsquo;s important to decide on a color scheme. This will help you determine which colors to use and how they should be used. Try using three or four colors that you like and see how they look together. Once you have a basic idea of what you want, start filling in the background with neutral colors. You can then add accents with brighter or darker shades.</p><p>Think about Contrast
