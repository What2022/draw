Drawing a beautiful butterfly is an easy process that can be learned with some basic steps. Start by sketching out the outline of your butterfly shape on paper. Next, use a thin pencil to draw in the wings and body. Be sure to use simple lines and shapes to help you create an accurate portrayal of your butterfly. Finally, use a light color to adddetails to your design and finish off by adding any highlights or shadows desired.</p><h2 id=clay-bust-project-1>Clay Bust Project<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#clay-bust-project-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.functionalstone.com/cv/images/clay-bust-(5a).jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.1YYKT48_VsRMA2GTeh_J6gHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="Clay Bust Project"><p><em>Source: functionalstone.com</em></p><blockquote><p>bust clay project functionalstone.</p></blockquote><p>It is never too late to get into art.
