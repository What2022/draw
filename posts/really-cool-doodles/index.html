Next, add in the other colors as needed. For example, if you wanted to make a red and green band across the top of your paper, start with the colors in shades of red and green (or purple and yellow), then add in blue and indigo later. Finally, put any final touches on your rainbow by drawing reflections of each color on both sides of your paper.</p><h2 id=15-beautiful-easy-drawing-ideas--beautiful-easy-drawings-easy>15 Beautiful Easy Drawing Ideas | Beautiful Easy Drawings, Easy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#15-beautiful-easy-drawing-ideas--beautiful-easy-drawings-easy>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/09/df/14/09df1486d290abe74fc6f3d0bb112eae.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cYhj-5R4xH9hHJ23q-XrbQHaKO&pid=15.1"' alt="15 Beautiful Easy Drawing Ideas | Beautiful easy drawings, Easy"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>zeichenideen shihoriobata doodles.</p></blockquote><h2 id=what-is-the-darkest-pencil>What Is The Darkest Pencil?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-the-darkest-pencil>#</a></h2><p>The darkest pencil is the F-95.
