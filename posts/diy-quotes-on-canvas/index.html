One way is to use a soft pencil and start with the bottom of the page. Use light colors to fill in the spaces between the lines, and dark colors to create depth. Try not to use too much white or black, as it will make the image look too stark.
If you’re looking to color in your Sketchbook without any outside help, there are a few tips to keep in mind. One is to find a free online coloring tool that can be used for both Sketchbook and Paint. The other is to practice regularly, so that you get better at the skill. After all, if it wasn’t for practice, you might not even be able to realize the potential that you have when coloring within the lines of your artwork!</p><h2 id=beetlejuice-svg-design-for-t-shirt-diy-vinyl-decals--etsy-in-2021>Beetlejuice SVG Design For T-Shirt DIY Vinyl Decals | Etsy In 2021<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#beetlejuice-svg-design-for-t-shirt-diy-vinyl-decals--etsy-in-2021>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1e/35/06/1e3506f258df10f70dd63a3674d96d65.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.yKMtIFNjjH7C9TNghkDQUwHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Beetlejuice SVG Design for T-Shirt DIY Vinyl Decals | Etsy in 2021"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>beetlejuice silhouette.</p></blockquote><h2 id=what-are-the-best-things-to-draw>What Are The Best Things To Draw?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-are-the-best-things-to-draw>#</a></h2><p>There are many things to draw, but some of the best things to draw are flowers, people, animals, and landscapes.
