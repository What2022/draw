There are a few ways to draw a silly mouth. One way is to use a simple line down the center of the mouth and then draw a small smile near the top of the line. Another way is to use curves and lines around the mouth, making it look like it’s trying to say something but not being able to quite get out the words. Drawing a silly mouth is not difficult, but it takes some creativity. Here are five tips to help you get started:\nUse a light pencil to outline the inside of your mouth in a thin line. This will give your mouth a more natural look. Use curves and contours to make your mouth more realistic. For example, add a jagged line down the center of your lower lip or create circles around your eyes. Add details such as furrows in your brow, wrinkles on your forehead, or even moustache growths if you want to make your character more different-looking than the others in the story. When drawing lips, use a light pencil and draw them slightly curled up at the top because they will eventually turn into a smile when spoken aloud.

One way is to use a simple line down the center of the mouth and then draw a small smile near the top of the line. Another way is to use curves and lines around the mouth, making it look like it&rsquo;s trying to say something but not being able to quite get out the words.
Drawing a silly mouth is not difficult, but it takes some creativity. Here are five tips to help you get started:</p><ol><li>Use a light pencil to outline the inside of your mouth in a thin line. This will give your mouth a more natural look.</li><li>Use curves and contours to make your mouth more realistic. For example, add a jagged line down the center of your lower lip or create circles around your eyes.</li><li>Add details such as furrows in your brow, wrinkles on your forehead, or even moustache growths if you want to make your character more different-looking than the others in the story.</li><li>When drawing lips, use a light pencil and draw them slightly curled up at the top because they will eventually turn into a smile when spoken aloud.</li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/tags/drawing/>Drawing</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://what2022.github.io/draw/posts/white-bedroom-decor/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>White Bedroom Decor - Living Beige Elegant Rooms Catchy Decorating Eye Very</span></a>
